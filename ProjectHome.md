This is a viewer for PGN Chess Files for Mac OS X 10.6+

Other OSes have good Chess programs already, so perhaps this won't be developed further to other OSes.

Dedicated to the creators and users of Chess.com, the best place for playing chess online (and in mobile devices!), to learn chess and to play with humans :-)

Some more details:

- Multi window application for opening Chess PGN files.

- Full PGN support including variations.

- Engine for PGN parsing and displaying chess games is pgn4web by Paolo Casaschi, also a Google Code project at http://code.google.com/p/pgn4web

- Mac OS X wrapper is by Timothy Ha, http://timh.ru/
